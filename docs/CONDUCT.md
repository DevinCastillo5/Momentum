# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community
* No Distracted Technology Use: Phones, laptops, and other personal devices should
  be put away unless they are necessary for meeting-related tasks.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind.
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[INSERT CONTACT METHOD].
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## Our Team Rules:

*Decisions: Decisions will be made based on a majority vote, where more than 50%
  of the team members must agree for a decision to pass.

*Attendance: All members should be available for meeting times, as they will adapt to all schedules.
 Only legitimate reasons like sickness, or other valid excuses should be used for a meeting. Missing
 members should ask for an update on what was done in the meeting to get up to date and do their assigned
 part. 

*Assignments: Assignments will be divided fairly, and expected to be completed on time
 There will be a deadline to get our parts done on time to review it the next day and add it all together. 
 Members who fail to turn in on time should communicate a valid reason. If unable to turn it in,
 the remaining members will divide the parts to be done.

 *Participation: We have a group chat to communicate, each task will have a person assigned. Members need to
 communicate their strengths to be honored within that frame. 

 *Meeting Times and Locations: It'll be flexible depending on the week and what tasks are to be completed. Then
 we will communicate our weekly availability and when we can meet.

 *Agenda and Minutes /Notes: For the agenda and minutes member Alanis Irizarry will take note of it on a shared 
 Google Doc.
 
 *Promptness: Any lateness should be excused beforehand and see if possible to get it done within a 24 hour timeframe.
 If not possible, they will be held accountable and the remaining group members will divide it and finish on their end.

 *Conversational Courtesies: If a meeting is done on Zoom, then keep cameras on to encourage active listening. If in person then make 
 sure. Everyone should listen when someone is talking.
 *Enforcement/ Feedback: We should give direct feedback in a respectful manner, trying to keep in mind the majority rules implementation that we have.
